# N Queens!
The n queens puzzle is the problem of placing n chess queens on an n×n chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of `n=2` and `n=3`.

## Counting Solutions
The following tables give the number of solutions for placing n queens on an n × n board, both fundamental (sequence [A002562](https://oeis.org/A002562) in the [OEIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences)) and all (sequence [A000170](https://oeis.org/A000170) in the [OEIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences)).
