# N Queens!
The n queens puzzle is the problem of placing n chess queens on an n√ón chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of `n=2` and `n=3`.
